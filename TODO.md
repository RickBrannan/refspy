# TODO

* Add include_none=True -> Return tuples with (str, None) for unmatched references; mark as errors
* Have matcher use name, abbrev, code, aliases, as needed. Thus limit test parsing and URL parsing to sensible regexps. 
* Combine and simplify ranges, incl. by default
* Generate links to online bibles (with decorators and ad hoc aliases?)
