# To Do List

## Status

* `0.9.16` Matches two-letter aliases by default, except for ambiguous words.
* `0.9.7` is feature-complete. 
* `0.9.13` Adds indexes, hotspots, tweaks for integration. 

## Next 

* Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki as a live demo and
  playground); expand test suites to reflect special cases. 
* Collect a gallery of difficult source texts.

## Possibilities

* match dot separators, not just colons?
* match dots at the end of abbreviations (`Mt. 15`, needed for APA style)
* match roman numerals for chapters? ("quaint mode")

## More remote possibilities 

* Other languages and language conventions?
* Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF)?
* Special cases like 'zero verses' in LXX Psalms, etc?
