# To Do List

## Status

* `0.9.7` is feature-complete. 

## NOW: July 2024

* Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki as a live demo and playground).
* Expand test suites to reflect special cases. 

## Possibilities

* Other languages and language conventions?
* Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF)?
* Special cases like zero verses in LXX Psalms, etc?
