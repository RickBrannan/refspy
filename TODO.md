# To Do List

* Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki).
* Have matcher use name, abbrev, code, aliases, as needed. Thus limit test parsing and URL parsing to sensible regexps. 
* Generate links to online bibles (with decorators and ad hoc aliases?)

## Things requiring other people's knowledge:

* Other languages and knowledge of language conventions.
* Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF).
* Special cases like zero verses in LXX Psalms, etc.
