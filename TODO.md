# To Do List

## Status

* `0.9.16`: Matches dots at the end of abbreviations (`Mt. 15`, needed for APA style) and as separators; Matches two-letter aliases by default except for ambiguous words.
* `0.9.13`: Adds indexes, hotspots, tweaks for integration. 
* `0.9.7`: is feature-complete. 

## Next 

* Test against human writing styles (use Article Wiki as a live demo and playground); expand test suites to reflect special cases. 
* Collect a gallery of difficult source texts.

## Possibilities

* Make spaces between name and number references optional.
* Match roman numerals for chapters? ("quaint mode")

## More remote possibilities 

* Other languages and language conventions?
* Other corpuses (Septuagint, Apostolic Father, ANF)?
* Special cases like 'zero verses' in LXX Psalms, etc?
