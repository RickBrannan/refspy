        <p><b>REFSPY</b>. <i>A Python library for working with biblical
        references in ordinary text.</i></p>
        <p>In the demonstration text below, references are highlighted in
        green, while book names that aren't themselves references but are used
        for context are highlighted in yellow. The identified references are
        noted in superscript, and an index is compiled at the end.</p>



    <pre>
Human-written Bible references look like Rom 1:1, 6-7, 1 Cor 2-3, or Phlm 2-3.
They can use spaces in the number part and commas between references. A
reference to a book, say Second Corinthians, will provide context for
references that follow, say, 5:21 or vv.25,37-38. If we refer to say Romans
(but then add a reference to Gal 4:4 in parentheses), a subsequent reference
like 12:16 will still be to Romans.

    <p>
Human-written Bible references look like <span class="green">Rom 1:1, 6-7</span><sup>Rom 1:1,6–7</sup>, <span class="green">1 Cor 2-3</span><sup>1 Cor 2–3</sup>, or <span class="green">Phlm 2-3</span><sup>Phlm 2–3</sup>.
They can use spaces in the number part and commas between references. A
reference to a book, say <span class="yellow">Second Corinthians</span>, will provide context for
references that follow, say, <span class="green">5:21</span><sup>2 Cor 5:21</sup> or <span class="green">vv.25,37-38</span><sup>2 Cor 5:25,37–38</sup>. If we refer to say <span class="yellow">Romans</span>
(but then add a reference to <span class="green">Gal 4:4</span><sup>Gal 4:4</sup> in parentheses), a subsequent reference
like <span class="green">12:16</span><sup>Rom 12:16</sup> will still be to <span class="yellow">Romans</span>.
</p>
    <p><b>Index</b>. Rom 1:1,6–7; 12:16; 1 Cor 2–3; 2 Cor 5:21,25,37–38; Gal 4:4; Phlm 2–3</p>
    <p> Because a number or a range (1 or 2-3) could refer to either verses or
    chapters, or other regular numbers that have nothing to do with biblical
    referencing, we only match references that are preceded by a book name, a
    chapter number and colon (4:), or a verse marker (v., vv.).</p>
