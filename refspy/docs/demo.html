        <p>In the text below, references are highlighted in green, while book
        names that aren't themselves references, but are used for context, are
        highlighted in yellow. The identified references are noted in
        superscript, and an index is compiled at the end.



    <pre>
Bible references look like Rom 1:1,6-7, 1 Cor 2-3, or Phlm 2-3, with no spaces
in the number part. Whereas '2-3' indicates verses in Philemon it indicates
whole chapters in 1 Corinthians. If we've already mentioned a book like Second
Corinthians or II Cor (allowing line wrapping), we'll want to identify
subsequent references, like 5:21 or vv.25,37-38, by the last mentioned book or
reference, like a human reader. If we refer to say Hebrews (but then Revelation
in parentheses), subsequent references like 10:10 will still be to Hebrews.
