        <p><b>REFSPY</b>. <i>A Python library for working with biblical
        references in ordinary text.</i></p>
        <p>In the demonstration text below, references are highlighted in <span
        class="green">green</span>, and identified in superscript<sup>Like
        This</sup>. Book names that aren't themselves references but provide
        context are highlighted in <span class="yellow">yellow</span>.
        Malformed references are highlighted in <span
        class="purple">purple</span>. An index is compiled, sorted, and
        collated by book. A second, compact index merges any overlapping or
        adjacent references.</p>



        <blockquote><pre>
Human-written Bible references look like Rom 12:1, 6-17, 2 Cor 1:2-3:4, or Phlm
2-3. They wrap lines, use spaces in the number part, and have commas both
between and within references. They are sometimes malformed, like Matt 1:10000
or 1:3-2, but might also use abbreviations like Ps 119:122-24. A book name,
such as Second Corinthians, provides context for references that follow, such
as 5:21 or vv.25,37-38. If we refer to Romans (but then add a reference to 2
Cor 3:5-8 in parentheses), a subsequent reference like 12:16 will still be to Romans.
Using letters as partial verses, as in II Cor 5:30a-40d, has no consistent
meaning and must be read as whole verses.

        <p> Because a number or a range (1 or 2-3) could refer to either verses or
        chapters, or other regular numbers that have nothing to do with biblical
        referencing, we only match references that are preceded by a book name, a
        chapter number and colon (4:), or a verse marker (v., vv.).</p>
